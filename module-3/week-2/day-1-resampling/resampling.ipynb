    "## The Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap is a widely applicable and extremely powerful statistical tool that can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method.\n",
    "\n",
    " - As an example:the bootstrap can be used to estimate the standard errors of the coefficients from a linear regression fit.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Similarly later on we will see that in random forests we will use bootstrapping tool to be able to cope with variance. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "__Bootstrapping:__ In bootstrapping we will create new samples. But rather than repeatedly obtaining independent data sets from the population, we instead obtain distinct data sets by repeatedly sampling observations from the original data set. __Important point:__ the sampling is performed by replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to invest a fixed sum of money in two financial assests that yield returns of X and Y, respectively, where X and Y are random quantities. We will invest a fraction $\\alpha$ of our money in X and will invest the remaining $1-\\alpha$ in Y. Our goal is to minimize risk, in other words, minimize the variance in our investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We know that the $\\alpha$ value that minimizes the risk can be given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{Y} - \\sigma_{XY}}{\\sigma^{2}_{X} + \\sigma^{2}_{Y} - 2\\sigma_{XY}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\sigma^{2}_{X} = \\text{Var}(X)$, $\\sigma^{2}_{Y} = \\text{Var}(Y)$ and $\\sigma_{XY} = \\text{Cov}(X,Y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__In reality:__ These quantities are not know as they are the parameters of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "__In practice:__ We can try to estimate $\\alpha$ from sample."
